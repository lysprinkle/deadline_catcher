This revision has been approved by the department with the goal of improving the student experience in your graduate program. Please carefully review\n \nALL\n the information.\n\n\nEffective Fall 2023, newly admitted students to the Urbana MCS program will have the opportunity to fulfill all MCS degree requirements in four regular (Fall and Spring) semesters rather than three regular semesters under certain circumstances. Requests to complete the MCS requirements in four regular semesters must be pre-approved by the CS Graduate Advising Office.\n\n\nAll students who wish to enroll for a 4\nth\n semester must be pre-approved by the CS Graduate Academic Advising Office prior to their fourth semester. \nStudents who wish to complete the degree requirements in four semesters must have no more than 12 credit hours and no less than 3 credit hours remaining in their program requirements to complete in the fourth semester\n.\n If an MCS student does not qualify for or is ineligible to remain enrolled for a 4\nth\n semester, then they must plan to complete all MCS degree course requirements and graduate by the end of their third semester. Students are expected to graduate at the end of the semester in which they complete all required coursework, regardless of being approved for a fourth semester or not.\n\n\nBelow are three examples of how an MCS student can be approved for a 4\nth\n semester.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Semester\n - Complete 12 credit hours of relevant coursework + \nSecond Semester\n - Complete 12 hours of relevant coursework + \nThird Semester\n - Participate in a Full-Time Internship (+ \nFourth Semester\n – Complete remaining 8 credit hours to fulfill degree requirements)\n\n\nFirst Semester\n - Complete 12 credit hours of relevant coursework + \nSecond Semester\n - Hold a TA/RA assistantship and complete 9 credit hours of relevant coursework + \nThird Semester\n - Participate in a Full-Time Internship (+ \nFourth Semester\n – Complete remaining 11 credit hours to fulfill degree requirements)\n\n\nFirst Semester\n – Hold a TA/RA assistantship and Complete 9 credit hours of relevant coursework +\n Second Semester\n - Hold a TA/RA assistantship and complete 9 credit hours of relevant coursework + \nThird Semester\n - Hold a TA/RA assistantship and complete 9 credit hours of relevant coursework (+ Fourth Semester - Not hold a TA/RA assistantship and complete the 5 remaining credit hours required to fulfill degree requirements.)\n\n\n\n\nStudents who are deemed on\n \nAcademic Warning\n \nor are otherwise not deemed to be making good academic progress (at the discretion of CS Graduate Advising) by the end of their second semester will not be eligible to be approved for a fourth semester in the MCS program. \n\n\nA form will be made available to students after their 2nd completed semester to request this extension to a 4th semester. CS Graduate Advising will not evaluate a student for this option prior to that.\n\n\nAn Open Advising Session will be held in the Fall 2024 semester to provide more information about the 4\nth\n semester approval process.\n\n\nThis opportunity is a privilege and MCS students wishing to consider and be approved for this opportunity are expected to abide by the policies as laid out by the Graduate Academic Advising Office."

We strongly urge our students to first make a reasonable effort to find information prior to reaching out to the academic advising office. This strategy helps you to find the answers to basic questions quickly and allows the academic advising staff to respond faster to the more complicated questions and administrative needs our students may have.\n\n\nThe same expectation of effort applies to how you write your emails. Take just a little extra time to ensure your message is clearly communicated to the recipient. Even if English isn't your first or best language, a quick spell check and rereading of the message before sending can do a lot to help the readability.\n\n\nUnclear emails often result in a few extra emails back and forth just to get student and advisor on the same page. Here are some tips to make your emails as clear as possible so your advisor spends less time trying to decipher it and more time responding to it.\n\n\n\n\nAlways use your @illinois.edu email.\n In your initial message, give your name as it appears on your record and your UIN. This helps us find your record so we can address your specific issue. We will not respond to student questions sent from an external address.\n\n\nA descriptive but brief subject line helps staff understand the context of your message, and also helps them find it easily later.\n\n\n\n\"Summer CPT Policy\" is much better than \"question\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly state what you need, and ask (don't demand) for what help we can offer.\n\n\n\n\"I'm having trouble registering for CS 527. I get an error, 'Program Restriction'. Could you help me understand the issue?\" is far better than the vague \"I can't add a class. Help me add it.\""

If your question isn't urgent and you don't feel like waiting for your turn in the queue, then it may be better to email your advisor. If you join the queue to speak to a specific advisor and they are not available, we may suggest you email them.\n\n\nThe next page will go over specifics about the Queue.\n\n\nWhether via the queue or direct email, we most commonly correspond with students via email.

(Before Fall 2024 this status was called Academic Probation. Any references you see to Academic Probation are referring to what is now Academic Warning.)\n\n\nWhat are the Consequences of Being on Warning status?\n\n\nStudents on Academic Warning are not eligible to hold an assistantship or fellowship unless they petition the Graduate College for an exception. Most importantly, the student has one semester while on Warning to improve their GPA above a 3.0. Failure to do so will result in the Graduate College placing the student on Drop status. All courses for future semesters will be dropped, and the student is dismissed from the Graduate College. For international students this can result in loss of visa status.\n\n\nWhile Warning itself is not impossible to recover from, it is a serious situation to be avoided. MCS students on Warning will be contacted by the CS Graduate Advising Office to schedule a mandatory meeting with an Academic Advisor. This meeting will focus on making sure the student understands Academic Warning and the minimum GPA requirements, and also to form a plan to improve their academic performance going forward.\n\n\nStudents who are placed on \"Drop\" Status may appeal to be reinstated in the program.

It can be very easy typing on a keyboard in your home to forget that your words are being delivered to a person. While this is important to keep in mind for all online communication, they are especially so when interacting with student colleagues, supervisors, instructors, and advisors.\n\n\nBe mindful of tone in your emails, as tone is difficult to communicate via text alone. Sarcasm, emojis, netspeak, and subtle humor can easily be misunderstood by the reader and result in miscommunication. Unless you already have an established rapport with the recipient, keep your emails plain, simple, and to the point.\n\n\nRemember We Are Human\n\n\nEmails to an individual advisor or to our office inbox are read by a real human being: a person with a job, responsibilities, stresses, and deadlines. We are here to help and support each of you. We expect all members of our community (including faculty, students, staff, alumni, and visitors) to uphold the highest standards of \nethical, respectful, and collegial conduct\n and to be mindful of the impact of their actions on others. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or abuse of power imbalances.\n\n\nBe respectful and courteous in your language in your communications. Rude, offensive, or hateful language will not be tolerated. If you're angry or stressed, before sending the advisors a message ask yourself if you'd send the same message to your boss at a job?

You can't see the person on the other end, and you may not even know who they are, so it can be stressful to wait your turn when you aren't waiting in a physical line.\n\n\nJust as the last page went over, remember that when you send an email, it goes to someone. That person may be busy with other emails, or they may need to consult a colleague or supervisor to get the right info to respond to you.

While your needs are important to us, please remember that our office is also assisting your peers with their needs at the same time. On top of this, many processes require input and approval from units outside of our control, such as the Graduate College, ISSS, and the Office of the Registrar, before the academic advisors can respond to your message(s).\n\n\nDue to these factors, please allow up to 2-3 business days for us to respond to your emails or process your forms. Be mindful of working hours in your expectations. Emails sent in the evenings, over weekends, or on holidays will be addressed when we return to the office. We ask that you await our response over the expected wait time period. Here are some examples of not respecting the staff's time to respond to your inquiries in a timely manner:\n\n\n    • Emailing a list of questions Tuesday morning and then sending an email Tuesday afternoon asking when we will respond.\n    • Sending a form on Friday afternoon and entering the Advising Queue fist thing Monday morning asking why the form hasn't been processed.\n    • Emailing one person and then sending the same request to more people thinking this will get you a quicker response.\n\n\nWe respond to all emails and requests in the order they were received, so please be patient. Sending the same request to multiple people only serves to confuse the process and duplicate effort. If you email someone, respect their time enough to wait for them to reply before seeking ways to force a faster response.\n\n\nBe especially careful with the use of subject line modifiers such as \"Urgent\", \"Time Sensitive\", or all caps.

One would be counted as Additional Coursework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCS students are discouraged from taking CS 597 multiple times, especially if there are other degree requirements remaining.\n\n\nRegistration in CS 597 requires approval from both the supervising faculty and the CS Department. \nStudents interested in the course should first reach out directly to faculty to discuss their interest and come up with a 5-7 sentence project description. Next, the student should submit the project to the \nCS Independent Study portal\n. The request is automatically routed to the faculty and to departmental staff for review. If approved at both levels, you will receive an email with instructions on how to add the course to your schedule.\n\n\nStudents are responsible for communicating with the instructor to agree upon timelines for progress, and students are responsible for completing the work by the end of the semester. CS Graduate Advising will not communicate with faculty on behalf of students."

        "body": "MCS students can possibly transfer previously completed coursework to be counted toward their MCS degree. There are 3 main types of credit transfers, but generally only one will apply to any given student and there is a total limit of 12 credits that may be transferred. Regardless of how many credits are transferred, remember that the MCS degree requires at least 24 credits be CS courses taken at UIUC. CS Dept policy requires students to complete at least one semester in our program before initiating such a request.\n\n\nCoursework taken as an undergrad at UIUC\n\n\nIf you completed your bachelor’s degree at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and have completed at least one semester in our grad program, you my be able to submit a Change of Course Level (CCL) form to change certain courses from Undergraduate level to Graduate. Courses need to meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nMust be 4XX or 5XX level.\n\n\nCourses can not have been used to meet \nany\n requirements for the bachelors degree.\n\n\n\nThis includes major requirements, credit hours, residency hours, GPA etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse must have been taken for a credit amount that is valid for graduate students in the course.\n\n\n\nSome courses (e.g., CS 415) do not offer 3 credits for grad students. So if it was taken for 3 as an undergrad, but grads can only earn 4, the course isn't eligible to move to a graduate degree.\n\n\nSee the Course Explorer listing to see how many credit hours a course offers. For example, \nCS 415\n says \"3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA letter grade of B or better if courses graded on standard letter grading, or Satisfactory if graded on S/U basis.\n\n\n\nCourses elected for CR/NC grading are not eligible to be used toward a CS graduate degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents seeking this type of transfer should first consult with an advisor for their undergraduate program or with their undergraduate college office to discuss which course(s) may be eligible to leave the BS degree. Afterward they can submit the \nCCL form\n to Joseph Zarnsy via email for review. The form must be approved by both the undergraduate college office as well as the Graduate College and ultimately the Office of the Registrar. Please allow several weeks for the entire process.\n\n\nCoursework taken while in another UIUC department's graduate program\n\n\nIf you were previously in another graduate program at UIUC and completed courses that are valid for MCS degree progress, you may be able to petition the Graduate College to transfer them from the other program to CS. To be eligible to transfer:\n\n\n\n\nCourses should be graduate-level 4XX or 5XX courses that are valid for MCS degree progress.\n\n\nCourses can not have been used to meet \nany\n requirements for another degree.\n\n\nA letter grade of B or better if courses graded on standard letter grading, or Satisfactory if graded on S/U basis.\n\n\n\nCourses elected for CR/NC grading are not eligible to be used toward a CS graduate degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents seeking this type of transfer should first consult with the other graduate program to determine if the course is eligible to be lost from that degree. Afterward they can submit a \nGraduate College petition\n to formally request the transfer. It is recommended you specifically list each course being requested along with the term completed. Once submitted, the request needs to be approved by both departments before being routed to the Graduate College for final approval and processing. Please allow several weeks for the entire process.\n\n\nCoursework taken at another accredited university in the US\n\n\nGraduate-level coursework completed at another university may be able to be transferred here to meet MCS requirements\n.\n To be eligible to transfer:\n\n\n\n\nCourses should be graduate-level courses related to Computer Science.\n\n\nCourses can not have been used to meet \nany\n requirements for another degree or transcripted credential (minor, etc.).\n\n\nA letter grade of B or better if courses graded on standard letter grading, or Satisfactory if graded on S/U basis.\n\n\n\nCourses elected for CR/NC grading are not eligible to be used toward a CS graduate degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents seeking this type of transfer should submit a \nGraduate College petition\n with the following documents attached.\n\n\n\n\nOfficial transcript dated within 6 months of the date of submitting the petition.\n\n\nOfficial letter from the Registrar, Academic Office, or other equivalent administrative body of that university stating that the courses in question were not used toward a degree or other transcripted credential.\n\n\nA syllabus for each course.\n\n\n\n\nEach course syllabus in question is reviewed by CS faculty, but ultimately the Graduate College has final say on whether or not the courses will be approved, and what they will count as if approved. This entire process can take up to 6 months."

To understand your rights and responsibilities as a graduate student at UIUC, please review \nArticle 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity and Procedure \nof the Student Code at \nhttps://studentcode.illinois.edu/\n.\n\n\nThe following constitute academic integrity infractions at UIUC: Cheating; Plagiarism; Fabrication; Facilitating Infractions of Academic Integrity; Bribes, Favors, and Threats; and Academic Interference.\n\n\nThe Honor Code of the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science is an additional required reading for this onboarding course.  Please review the Honor Code at \nhttps://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code\n for additional information about policies, procedures, and shared values in the community.\n\n\nEach course offered at UIUC can have specific guidelines and expectations related to academic integrity, described in the course syllabus. Please carefully review each course syllabus so that you understand the expectations for each course. If you are unclear about course expectations, requirements, and other guidelines as they relate to academic integrity listed above, please do not hesitate to consult with your instructor or teaching assistants. Lack of knowledge is not an excuse for academic integrity violations.\n\n\nPossible Sanctions\n\n\nThe following are recommended sanctions for cheating in a CS course (source: \nhttps://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code\n)\n\n\n\n\nFirst offense for cheating:\n\n\n\n\non an exam: zero on the exam\n\n\non a programming assignment, quiz, or written homework: zero on the assignment and final course grade is lowered by one whole letter grade.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple instances of cheating of any kind: failure in the course.\n\n\n\n\nIt is your responsibility to be fully informed of the policies and practices above to help you maintain academic integrity as a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nHere is an example scenario of cheating. Note that different courses may have completely different scenarios. One 500-level course required students to attend lectures and submit a report at the end of each lecture. Students could omit several reports without affecting their grade. However, several students submitted reports without attending the lecture. All these students were sanctioned with a reduced grade. Simply not submitting the reports would have likely had no negative effect on their grade."
